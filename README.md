# Simulation-Transformation-and-Convergence-of-Random-Variables
Used MATLAB to simulate uniform, normal and exponential distributions for increasing sample sizes. Verified the weak law of natural numbers and central limit theorem by transforming these random variables. Tested convergence in mean square, in probability, in distribution and almost sure convergence.
